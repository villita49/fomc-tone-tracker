      "text": "Chair Powell spoke at the NABE Annual Meeting in Nashville. He discussed the economic outlook, noting that the economy has made significant progress toward the Fed's dual mandate goals. Inflation has come down substantially from its peak while the labor market has remained resilient. Powell emphasized the Fed is well positioned to respond to risks on either side of the dual mandate. He described policy as 'moderately restrictive' and signaled patience, noting the Fed is not in a hurry to adjust rates and will make decisions meeting by meeting based on incoming data. He acknowledged uncertainty from trade policy and fiscal policy but said the underlying economy remains solid. Powell reiterated the Fed's commitment to returning inflation to 2% while sustaining a healthy labor market.",

      "text": "Powell spoke at the Dallas Fed on the economic outlook. He characterized inflation as still somewhat elevated but making further progress toward 2%. The labor market has cooled from its overheated state but remains solid. Powell described the current level of interest rates as 'moderately restrictive' and well-positioned. He said the Fed can afford to be patient and careful as it considers further adjustments, emphasizing data dependence. He noted risks are two-sided \u2014 inflation could re-accelerate or the labor market could weaken more than expected. The tone was balanced, signaling no urgency to cut rates further while leaving the door open to future adjustments.",

He emphasized the committee is in no hurry to make further adjustments and wants to see more progress on inflation before cutting. Powell noted inflation remains somewhat elevated above the 2% target and the labor market is solid. He described policy as 'meaningfully restrictive' and said the Fed does not need to be in a hurry. When asked about potential tariff impacts, he acknowledged tariffs could put upward pressure on inflation and said the Fed would watch carefully. The overall tone was firmly on hold \u2014 patience and data dependence were the dominant themes.",

He characterized inflation as still too high but declining, and expressed confidence that inflation will continue to fall toward 2%. He described the labor market as cooling but not deteriorating. Waller argued the current policy stance is appropriately restrictive and that further cuts are warranted as inflation continues to fall. He signaled that if inflation data remains cooperative, he would support continued gradual rate reductions. His tone was moderately dovish \u2014 more optimistic on inflation progress than peers and more willing to keep cutting.",

He described the current policy stance as 'well positioned' and said the Fed is in a good place to be patient and assess incoming data. Jefferson expressed particular attention to labor market risks, noting that any significant weakening would warrant a policy response. He signaled that with policy restrictive and the economy solid, there is no urgency to adjust rates in either direction.",
